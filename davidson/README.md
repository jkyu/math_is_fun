# Davidson Solver

## Summary
Implementation of a basic Davidson routine for finding extreme eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors without employing a full eigendecomposition. 

A brief background of the Davidson method is provided in `reference/background.pdf` and a simple implementation of the algorithm is in `davidson.py`.
