abstract="Widespread use of the linear variation method in quantum mechanics leads to the need for efficient matrix eigenvalue methods for real symmetric matrices. Efficiency must be judged, however, in terms of the ability to solve a variety of eigenvalue problems on computers of widely different architecture, memory size, and data transfer rates. To further confuse the situation, cost rather than system throughput, is usually of paramount concern. Additionally, algorithms vary widely in ease of programming, simplicity, reliability, portability and availability as part of standard packages. Consequently there are a wide variety of eigenvalue algorithms in use, and a typical quantum laboratory will incorporate several of these into their program package.",
