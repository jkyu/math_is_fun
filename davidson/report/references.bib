abstract="Widespread use of the linear variation method in quantum mechanics leads to the need for efficient matrix eigenvalue methods for real symmetric matrices. Efficiency must be judged, however, in terms of the ability to solve a variety of eigenvalue problems on computers of widely different architecture, memory size, and data transfer rates. To further confuse the situation, cost rather than system throughput, is usually of paramount concern. Additionally, algorithms vary widely in ease of programming, simplicity, reliability, portability and availability as part of standard packages. Consequently there are a wide variety of eigenvalue algorithms in use, and a typical quantum laboratory will incorporate several of these into their program package.",

By the use of integral operator kernel functions, one can efficiently compute principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces, related to input space by some nonlinear map—for instance, the space of all possible five-pixel products in 16 × 16 images. We give the derivation of the method and present experimental results on polynomial feature extraction for pattern recognition.}",
