Monte Carlo simulation to determine the value of pi.

A circle of radius r is inscribed in a square of 
side length 2r and area 4r^2.

X and Y are independent uniform random variables on [0, 2r].
This means that picking an x-coordinate at random says 
nothing about the y-coordinate in the (x, y) pair. 
This also means that there isn't any location on the line 
segment [0, 2r] that is favored over any other --
a point picked at random is equally likely to land
anywhere in the interval. 

With probablility P = 1, the sampled (x, y) coordinate 
lands in the square, but how often does it land inside
the circle versus outside of it? 

We know that the square has area 4r^2 and that the 
circle has an area proportional to r^2. 
A_circle = pi * r^2, where pi is that unknown 
proportionality constant.

Suppose we sample n points (x, y) from the joint 
distribution (X, Y). In the limit of large N, we 
expect that m number of points will land inside 
the circle out of the total n points. 
If we sample so many points that we completely
black out the square, we will find that the 
ratio m/n is exactly the ratio of the areas
of the inscribed circle to the square:
m/n = (pi*r^2)/(4r^2) = pi/4

Then we will find that pi will converge to
pi ~= 4 * m/n as we increase our sample size.
